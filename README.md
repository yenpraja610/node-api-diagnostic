# Diagnostic Template

Use this template to structure your READMEs for diagnostics.

Be sure to include a recent [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and Markdown linter
configuration ([`.remarkrc`](.remarkrc)). Also, include an appropriate
`.gitignore`; these are usually found in specific technology templates, for
example [js-template](https://www.github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-template).

## Prerequisites

-   Topics with which developers should be familiar with.
-   Prerequisites are "just-in-time", so if I have a prerequisite that mentions
    Sass, I would **not** need to include CSS as a prerequisite.
-   [Links to previous materials](https://www.github.com/ga-wdi-boston/example)
    are often useful.
-   In a diagnostic, it is useful to link to reference material, such as talk
    repositories.

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Install dependencies.
1.  Create and checkout a new branch, named `response`.
1.  Follow the directions given in [diagnostic.md](diagnostic.md).
1.  Before the alotted time is up, push to your fork and issue a pull request.

Your pull request description should contain a "fist to five" for comfort and
clarity. Additionally, you should mention the resources you used to help you
complete this assessment. For example:

```md
Comfort: 3
Clarity: 3

I used Google and my class notes to help with this assessment.
```

You may wish to refer to ["How do I submit diagnostics?"](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/Diagnostics)
and other [FAQs](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/) related to
[forking, cloning](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone),
and [pull requests](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/PullRequest).

You may use **any resource** other than each other to complete this diagnostic.
This includes referencing talk materials, appropriate documentation, and
searching for help online.

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors. After `grunt nag` passes, you should
run `grunt test` to run the included tests. Tests will tell you whether of not
your responses are correct.

It's probably a good idea to include the above verbatim in each diagnostic.
Remember to edit the link to the actual diagnostic file (it might be stored in a
different directory or have a different extension). If tooling is not included
in this diagnostic, feel free to remove that bit from these instructions.
